- ⚡ Not Fun fact: ...I dont like Most coding tutorials. i hate them. I can make a list of everything wrong with one tutorial. Maybe someday. 

1 have few arduino codes but i didnt upload here. 1 custom remote, 2 temp light logger,3 and i dont remember. but i will upload all of them one day. most important part is not codes it is example codes for 
your hardware is it working or not. there is multiple libs but not all of work. most stuff doesnt work.
2 i am not uploading all my codes because i changed to much stuff. changing directories,moving files,renamin. I am talking about All kinda codes. Mostly how to use snytax. 

3 Learning github git really complicanted for newbie, This place not really beginner friendly.
I can use now but ı dont want to use much. It is usefull.

I can so many stuff but I dont think doesnt matter much.

You can suggest me Tech to learn.
